# 958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a *complete binary tree*.

In a [complete binary tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees),
every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. 
It can have between `1` and `2h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

## Example 1:

## Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 1000`
